We'll ask about Toronto's record single-day snowfall.\n\n**Why this example works:**\n- The record was set on **January 25, 2026** - after the model's training data cutoff\n- Without grounding, the model can only guess based on historical data it was trained on\n- With grounding, the model searches the web and finds the recent news about this event\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that grounding enables access to information the model couldn't possibly know from training alone."
